# Chess Box

This is a dumb idea that I had to write a chess engine from scratch in C. Why? Your guess is as good as mine - I enjoy the game a bit too much I guess.

In future, this will also serve as my foray into cluster computing, as I plan on running this on a cluster of Raspberry Pis to calculate complex positions.
